This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on our website located at <a href="http://www.yourstudio.com">www.yourstudio.com</a> (the “Site”), the Company’s mobile applications, as well as (and shall include by definition) all interactive features, applications, widgets, social networks and social network “tabs”, and other online or wireless offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology or any associated content, material, or functionality contained on the Site. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and accept and consent to the privacy practices (and any uses and disclosures of information about you) that are described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
              <h2 id="changes-to-our-privacy-policy">Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>We expressly reserve the right to make any changes to this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice to you. All updates are effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Site signifies your consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy. </p>
              <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>We may collect identifying information from or about you in connection with your use of, participation with, or your submissions to, the Site (collectively, the “Collected Information”). Collected Information includes, without limitation, any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, physical address, business name, phone number, email address, and credit card number (and related information such as expiration date). If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, you may also be asked to provide certain Collected Information about such minor in order to obtain the services available on the Site. We use the information we collect to provide the services available via the Site. In order to continuously improve services, we may also ask you to provide additional information regarding your demographics, interests, and contact preferences.</p>
              <h2 id="cookies-and-usage-reports">Cookies and Usage Reports</h2>
              <p>By placing a small file known as a &quot;cookie&quot; on your device, Company’s and its third party service providers’ servers passively gather information about all visitors&#39; use of the Site for several reasons, including, but not limited to: statistics collection and analysis, Site optimization, analytics (as described below), market research, and maintenance of user login information. The information that we and our third party service providers track with cookies includes, but is not limited to, the type of browser (such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer) and Internet-connected devices being used to access the Site, your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, your home domain or Internet service provider, your referrer URL (which is the URL for the Site that you were viewing prior to visiting the Site), how you were directed to the Site, which specific pages you access on the Site, how long you view each page, the time and date you access the Site and the total number of visitors to the Site and any portions thereof. We, and/or our third party service providers, may use the information collected from cookies or similar files on your computer for security purposes (such as authentication), to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site. This data helps us and our third party service providers improve our respective product and services. </p>
              <p>Most popular Internet browser applications will allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your browser to reject cookies may, in certain instances, prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities, or cause some features of the Site to function improperly or more slowly. </p>
              <h2 id="google-analytics-and-web-beacons">Google Analytics and Web Beacons</h2>
              <p>Our Sites may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our Site and how we can improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a Site, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other Sites you used prior to coming to such Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit a Site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to Company Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Company Sites, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Company Sites to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Company Sites, please review “How Google uses data when you use our partners&#39; sites or apps.”  </p>
              <p>Some of the areas of the Site may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that allow Company, and its third party providers or affiliates, to count and track users who have visited certain portions of the Site. Web beacons collect only limited information and do not collect any of your personal information. Specifically, Company plans to use a type of web beacon known as a “retargeting pixel,” which will allow users to receive targeted advertising from Company via certain social media Sites, including Facebook.com.</p>
