              <h1 id="data-connection-internet-access-terms-of-service">Data Connection &amp; Internet Access Terms of Service</h1>
              <p>While you are at a Studio location, you may connect to our data network (the “network”) to access the internet. By using or accessing the network, you agree to these terms of service. We may revise these terms at any time. You are deemed to accept the current terms each time you use or access the network, and it is your responsibility to review it for any changes. If you do not accept these terms of service, you may not use the network.</p>
              <h2 id="access">Access</h2>
              <p>Your access to the network is at our discretion. Your access may be blocked, suspended or terminated at any time and for any reason, including violation of these terms of service, disruption of access to other users or networks or to otherwise protect us, our users, or other third parties.</p>
              <p>The connection is available to your device only when it is within wireless range of our access points or in your office or a conference room through a wired connection. The connection is generally subject to unavailability, including by reason of service or equipment failures. We are not responsible for any interruptions or performance issues with the network. Network speed will vary based on your device configuration, location, compression, network congestion and other factors. You are solely responsible for any devices, software, or other materials necessary for use of the connection.</p>
              <h2 id="privacy-security">Privacy &amp; Security</h2>
              <p>No data network or internet-based communication is 100% secure. Such communications can be intercepted by equipment and software. Subject to applicable law and in accordance with our privacy policy, we also have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor, intercept and review, and disclose, without further notice, any transmissions over or use of our connection to comply with lawful process, orders, warrants or subpoenas, or to protect our rights, property and users.</p>
              <h2 id="prohibited-uses">Prohibited Uses</h2>
              <p>You are prohibited from accessing or using (or attempting to access or use) the connection or taking any action online that violates any applicable law or regulation or that could harm us or any third party or interfere with the operation of the network to others. For example, among other items, you may not:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>upload or transmit through the connection any (a) computer viruses, worms, spam or anything else designed to interfere with or disrupt the normal operating procedures of a computer or network; or (b) any material which is defamatory, offensive, or of an obscene nature;</li>
              <li>take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our network or infrastructure or that violates or threatens or system or network security or that of our users or any third parties, including any attempt to circumvent any restrictions imposed on your access to or use of the connection or our other websites;</li>
              <li>use the connection to infringe or violate the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights of any third party;</li>
              <li>share your IP address or ISP Internet connection with anyone;</li>
              <li>reproduce, retransmit, disseminate, or resell the network connection or authorize any other individual or entity to use the network connection, whether for profit or not, without our express written permission.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Breaching “Prohibited Uses” may result in civil or criminal liability. We may report such breaches to relevant law enforcement authorities and co-operate with those authorities to prosecute users who violate these terms. We have the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or terminate your access and use of the connection and other services we may provide you and to block or remove any communications or materials transmitted through the connection.</p>
              <h2 id="additional-disclaimers-liability-limitation">Additional Disclaimers; Liability Limitation</h2>
              <p>We are providing the connection on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties and terms, express or implied, including warranties, terms or representations as to the availability, operation, security, performance and/or use of our services, or any other materials on or accessed via our services, or the accuracy, speed, availability or uptime of the services, network, or data, including any warranties or terms of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement and any implied warranties, terms or indemnification arising from course of dealing or course of performance.</p>
              <p>You waive any and all claims and rights against us and our affiliates, parents, and successors and each of our employees, assignees, officers, agents and directors (the “Studio Parties”) resulting from injury or damage to, or destruction, theft, or loss of, any property, person or pet, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. None of the Studio Parties will be liable to you under any cause of action, for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, reliance or punitive damages, including loss of profits or business interruption. You shall indemnify the Studio Parties from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), resulting from any breach of this agreement by you.
              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the exclusions and limitations above may not apply to you. In such event, such exclusions and limitations shall apply to the maximum extent allowed under applicable law.</p>
              <p>If you are a member, to the extent any dispute arises from the services described herein, they shall be brought in the forum, applying the law, described in the membership agreement (as may be amended by the terms thereof) signed up by you or the company with which you are affiliated. If you are not a member, to the extent any dispute arises from the services described herein, shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration rules of JAMS then in force, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York, U.S.A. and shall apply the law of the State of New York, U.S.A. and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof and without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or New York’s or any other implementation of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.</p>
