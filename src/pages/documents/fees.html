# Fee Policy
## a. Late Fee
If we have not received a monthly payment from you, you (Primary Member) will receive a non-payment notice on the 10th of the month along with a 10% late fee charge. If we do not receive payment from you during the month, you will continue to receive non-payment notices. If you believe you have received a late payment notice in error and you have already remitted payment, please send proof of your bank payment confirmation to your Community Management team.

These prints can be used by any member in the company, and they are all pooled together.
