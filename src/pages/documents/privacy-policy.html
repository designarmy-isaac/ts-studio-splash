# Privacy Policy

## Overview

*Last Updated: August 20, 2018*

Studio (“Company”) respects your privacy and is committed to complying with this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on our website located at www.yourstudio.com (the “Site”), the Company’s mobile applications, as well as (and shall include by definition) all interactive features, applications, widgets, social networks and social network “tabs”, and other online or wireless offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology or any associated content, material, or functionality contained on the Site. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and accept and consent to the privacy practices (and any uses and disclosures of information about you) that are described in this Privacy Policy. 

## Changes to our Privacy Policy

We expressly reserve the right to make any changes to this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice to you. All updates are effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Site signifies your consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy. 

## Information We Collect

We may collect identifying information from or about you in connection with your use of, participation with, or your submissions to, the Site (collectively, the “Collected Information”). Collected Information includes, without limitation, any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, physical address, business name, phone number, email address, and credit card number (and related information such as expiration date). If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, you may also be asked to provide certain Collected Information about such minor in order to obtain the services available on the Site. We use the information we collect to provide the services available via the Site. In order to continuously improve services, we may also ask you to provide additional information regarding your demographics, interests, and contact preferences.
## Cookies and Usage Reports

By placing a small file known as a "cookie" on your device, Company’s and its third party service providers’ servers passively gather information about all visitors' use of the Site for several reasons, including, but not limited to: statistics collection and analysis, Site optimization, analytics (as described below), market research, and maintenance of user login information. The information that we and our third party service providers track with cookies includes, but is not limited to, the type of browser (such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer) and Internet-connected devices being used to access the Site, your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, your home domain or Internet service provider, your referrer URL (which is the URL for the Site that you were viewing prior to visiting the Site), how you were directed to the Site, which specific pages you access on the Site, how long you view each page, the time and date you access the Site and the total number of visitors to the Site and any portions thereof. We, and/or our third party service providers, may use the information collected from cookies or similar files on your computer for security purposes (such as authentication), to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site. This data helps us and our third party service providers improve our respective product and services. 

Most popular Internet browser applications will allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your browser to reject cookies may, in certain instances, prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities, or cause some features of the Site to function improperly or more slowly. 

## Google Analytics and Web Beacons 

Our Sites may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our Site and how we can improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a Site, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other Sites you used prior to coming to such Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit a Site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to Company Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Company Sites, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Company Sites to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Company Sites, please review “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.”  

Some of the areas of the Site may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that allow Company, and its third party providers or affiliates, to count and track users who have visited certain portions of the Site. Web beacons collect only limited information and do not collect any of your personal information. Specifically, Company plans to use a type of web beacon known as a “retargeting pixel,” which will allow users to receive targeted advertising from Company via certain social media Sites, including Facebook.com.

If you correspond with Company through the Site or via email, the Collected Information may include the content of, and metadata regarding, any correspondence you may have with us.

## With Whom Do We Share Information That We Collect?

Company may share information we collect from this Site with its subsidiaries or related companies who may use it to send you information relating to other properties owned or managed by Tishman Speyer or events sponsored by or taking place on properties owned or managed by Tishman Speyer.

In addition to the uses mentioned or described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may catalog and add Collected Information to our database.

Company may use and disclose certain aggregated, anonymized information, such as Site usage data, to our trusted business partners. Such information may also be shared with other users or the general public for advertising, informational, or comparison purposes. 

We may also disclose Collected Information if we become subject to a subpoena or court order, or if we are otherwise legally required to disclose information. We may also use and disclose Collected Information to establish or exercise our legal rights, to enforce any of our terms of service, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person.

As Company grows and develops its business, it is possible that its corporate structure or organization might change or that it might merge or otherwise combine with, or that it or portions of its business might be acquired by, another company. In any such transactions, customer information generally is, and should be expected to be, one of the transferred business assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, your information may be considered a company asset that may be sold or transferred to third parties.

## Protecting Your Information

We take commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect information transmitted via or stored on the Site. Nevertheless, no Site is impenetrable.
